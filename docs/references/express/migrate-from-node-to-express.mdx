# Migrate from Clerk's Node SDK to the Express SDK

## Install the Express SDK

To migrate from the Clerk Node SDK to the Clerk Express SDK, uninstall the Node SDK by running the following command:

<CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  npm uninstall @clerk/clerk-sdk-node
  ```

  ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  yarn remove @clerk/clerk-sdk-node
  ```

  ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  pnpm remove @clerk/clerk-sdk-node
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

Then, install the Express SDK by running the following command:

<CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  npm install @clerk/express
  ```

  ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  yarn add @clerk/express
  ```

  ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  pnpm add @clerk/express
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

# Structure

- backend re-exports (import from backend instead)
- clerkClient and createClerkClient (the same, import from backend instead)
- ✅ ClerkExpressRequireAuth and createClerkExpressRequireAuth
- ✅ ClerkExpressWithAuth and createClerkExpressWithAuth
- ✅ withAuth from node (replaced with getAuth)
- ✅ requireAuth from node

## Migrate from `withAuth()`

If you previously used `withAuth()` to wrap your route handlers, you can now use [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/express/overview#get-auth) with the Express SDK. Pass the request object to `getAuth()` to retrieve the authentication state within the route handler.

`clerkMiddleware()` is required to be set in the middleware chain before this util is used, as shown in the following example.

```diff
- import { withAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node'
+ import { clerkMiddleware, getAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const port = 3000

+ app.use(clerkMiddleware())

- app.get('/path', withAuth((req, res) => res.json(req.auth)))
+ app.get('/auth-state', (req, res) => {
+  const authState = getAuth(req)
+  res.json(authState)
+ })

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```

## `requireAuth()` usage changes

In the Node SDK, `requireAuth()` wrapped route handlers. With the Express SDK, you must update `requireAuth()` to function as middleware instead of wrapping your handlers.

```diff
- import { requireAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node'
+ import { requireAuth, clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

+ // clerkMiddleware is required to be set in the middleware chain before requireAuth is used
+ app.use(clerkMiddleware())

- app.get('/', requireAuth(handler))
+ app.get('/', requireAuth, handler)
```

## Migrate from `ClerkExpressWithAuth`

To replace your existing Node SDK lax middleware, [`ClerkExpressWithAuth()`](/docs/backend-requests/handling/nodejs), you need to write your own middleware that uses [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/express/overview#get-auth) to retrieve the auth state and then return an empty object if the user is not authenticated.

```diff
- import { ClerkExpressWithAuth } from "@clerk/clerk-sdk-node";
+ import { clerkMiddleware, getAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const port = 3000

+ // clerkMiddleware is required to be set in the middleware chain before getAuth is used
+ app.use(clerkMiddleware())

+ const LaxMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
+   const auth = getAuth(req)
+   // If the user is not authenticated, return an empty object
+   req.auth = auth || {}
+   next()
+ }

// Define a protected route
- app.get('/protected-route', ClerkExpressWithAuth(), (req, res) => {
-   res.json(req.auth);
- })
+ app.get('/protected', LaxMiddleware, (req, res) => {
+   res.json(req.auth)
+ })

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```

## Migrate from `ClerkExpressRequireAuth`

To enforce strict authentication, replace your existing Node SDK strict middleware, [`ClerkExpressRequireAuth`](/docs/backend-requests/handling/nodejs), with the new Express SDK middleware, [`requireAuth`](/docs/references/express/require-auth).

`requireAuth` is a middleware function that you can use to protect routes in your Express.js application. This function checks if the user is authenticated, and returns a 401 status code if they are not.

`clerkMiddleware()` is required to be set in the middleware chain before this util is used, as shown in the following example.

```diff
- import {
-  ClerkExpressRequireAuth,
-  RequireAuthProp,
-  StrictAuthProp
- } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';
+ import { clerkMiddleware, requireAuth } from '@clerk/express';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

+ // clerkMiddleware is required to be set in the middleware chain before requireAuth is used
+ app.use(clerkMiddleware());

// Define a protected route
- app.get('/protected', ClerkExpressRequireAuth(), (req, res) => {
-   res.send('This is a protected route');
- });
+ app.get('/protected', requireAuth, (req, res) => {
+   res.send('This is a protected route');
+ });

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

## Migrate from `createClerkExpressWithAuth` and `createClerkExpressRequireAuth`

If you previously used `createClerkExpressWithAuth` or `createClerkExpressRequireAuth` to create custom middleware by passing in custom Clerk keys, a custom `clerkClient` instance, and/or a custom API URL, you can no longer use these methods with the Express SDK. Instead, use `clerkMiddleware` to create your custom middleware.

If you were passing a custom `clerkClient` instance, you can now pass it as an option to `clerkMiddleware` like this:

```js
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

app.use(clerkMiddleware({ clerkClient: 'xxx' }))
```

If you were passing custom Clerk keys or a custom API URL, pass those to `createClerkClient` from the [Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview#usage) and then pass the custom `clerkClient` into the middleware.

```diff
- import { createClerkExpressRequireAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node'
+ import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend'
+ import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

- const customMiddleware = createClerkExpressRequireAuth({ publishableKey: '', apiUrl: '', secretKey: '' })
+ const clerkClient = createClerkClient({ publishableKey: '', apiUrl: '', secretKey: '' })

+ app.use(clerkMiddleware({ clerkClient }))

- app.get('/path', customMiddleware, (req, res) => res.json(req.auth))
+ app.get('/path', (req, res) => res.json(req.auth))
```

## Backend SDK

### Removed imports

{/* TODO: I don't see this in the JS repo? I don't think this is true */}

With the Node SDK, you could import any of the Backend SDK methods directly from the Node SDK. With the Express SDK, you need to import the Backend SDK methods from the `@clerk/backend` package.

```diff
- import { someMethod, requireAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';
+ import { requireAuth } from '@clerk/express';
+ import { someMethod } from '@clerk/backend';

```

### `clerkClient` import

The `clerkClient` is used to access the [Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview), which exposes Clerk's backend API resources. If you were importing `clerkClient` from the Node SDK, you can import it from the Express SDK.

```diff
- import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';
+ import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/express';
```

### Instantiating a custom `clerkClient`

If you were instantiating a custom `clerkClient` with `createClerkClient`, you can no longer import this method from the Express SDK. You must import it from the [Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview#usage).

```diff
- import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';
+ import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend';
```

## Random Notes

- Why were StrictAuthProp and RequireAuthProp types imported in the requireAuth example?

- If you were using createClerkExpressWithAuth or createClerkExpressRequireAuth, these are no longer available. these methods allowed you to create your own middleware passing in custom clerk keys, clerkClient instance, and/or api url. If you need this functionality, here's how to do it with the express SDK
  - if you are passing a custom clerkClient, you can now pass that as an option to clerkMiddleware like this `clerkMiddleware({ clerkClient: 'xxx' })`
  - If you want to customize the clerk keys or api url, pass those to createClerkClient from backend SDK (link) and then pass the custom clerkClient into middeware and you good to go

```
- import { createClerkExpressRequireAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node'
+ import { clerkMiddleware, requireAuth } from '@clerk/express'
+ import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend'

- const requireAuth = createClerkExpressRequireAuth({ publishableKey: '', apiUrl: '', secretKey: '' })
+ const client = createClerkClient({ publishableKey: '', apiUrl: '', secretKey: '' })
+ app.use(clerkMiddleware({ clerkClient: client }))

...
app.get('/path', requireAuth, (req, res) => res.json(req.auth))

```

{/* TODO: withAuth isn't exported in express ? */}

- if you were using `requireAuth` or `withAuth` exports, you will need to move them to operating as middleware instead of wrapping your handlers

```diff
- import { requireAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node'
+ import { requireAuth, clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

+ app.use(clerkMiddleware())

- app.get('/', requireAuth(handler))
+ app.get('/', requireAuth, handler)
```
