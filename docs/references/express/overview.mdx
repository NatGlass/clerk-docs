# Clerk Express.js SDK

## Set up Clerk Express.js

<Steps>

### Create a Clerk application

You need to create a Clerk application in the Clerk Dashboard before you can set up `@clerk/express`. For more information on setting up a Clerk application, check out the [dedicated guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).

### Install `@clerk/express`

To get started using Clerk with Express.js, add the [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clerk/express) to your project:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
```sh filename="terminal"
npm install @clerk/express
```

```sh filename="terminal"
yarn add @clerk/express
```

```sh filename="terminal"
pnpm add @clerk/express
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment variables

<SignedIn>

Add the following keys to your `.env.local` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.

</SignedIn>

<SignedOut>

1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
2. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
3. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
4. Paste your keys into your `.env.local` file.

The final result should resemble the following:

</SignedOut>

  ```sh filename=".env.local"
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

</Steps>

## Available methods

The Clerk Express SDK exports the following:

- `@clerk/backend` - You can use [Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) to interact with the Clerk API.
- `clerkMiddleware()` - The [`clerkMiddleware()`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware) helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Express application. It is required to be set in the middleware chain before using other Clerk utilities, such as `requireAuth()` and `getAuth()`.
- `getAuth()` - The [`getAuth()`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) helper retrieves the authentication state, allowing you to protect your API routes or gather relevant data.
- `requireAuth()` - The [`requireAuth()`](/docs/references/express/require-auth) helper protects routes in your Express application by checking if the user is authenticated or authorized.
