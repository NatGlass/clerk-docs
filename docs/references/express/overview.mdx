# Clerk Express.js SDK

## Set up Clerk Express.js

<Steps>

### Create a Clerk application

You need to create a Clerk application in your Clerk Dashboard before you can set up Clerk Express.js. For more information, check out our [Set up your application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) guide.

### Install `@clerk/express`

To get started using Clerk with Express.js, add the [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clerk/express) to your project:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
```sh filename="terminal"
npm install @clerk/express
```

```sh filename="terminal"
yarn add @clerk/express
```

```sh filename="terminal"
pnpm add @clerk/express
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment variables

<SignedIn>

Add the following keys to your `.env.local` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.

</SignedIn>

<SignedOut>

1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
2. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
3. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
4. Paste your keys into your `.env.local` file.

The final result should resemble the following:

</SignedOut>

  ```sh filename=".env.local"
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

</Steps>

## Available methods

The Clerk Express SDK exports the following:

- `@clerk/backend` - You can use [Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) to interact with the Clerk API.
- `clerkMiddleware()` - The [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware) helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Next.js application through Middleware.
- `getAuth()` - The [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) helper retrieves the authentication state, allowing you to protect your API routes or gather relevant data.
- `requireAuth()` -

### Express error handlers

Express comes with a default error handler for errors encountered in the middleware chain.

Developers can also implement their own custom error handlers as detailed in the [Express error handling guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html). An example error handler can be found above.

If you are using the strict middleware variant, the `err` passed to your error handler will contain enough context for you to respond as you deem fit.
