# `requireAuth()`

`requireAuth()` is a middleware function that you can use to protect routes in your Express.js application. This function checks if the user is authenticated or authorized, and returns a 401 status code if they are not.

`clerkMiddleware()` is required to be set in the middleware chain before this util is used.

## Parameters

## Example

```js
import { clerkMiddleware, requireAuth } from '@clerk/express';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

const port = 3000;

// Apply centralized middleware
app.use(clerkMiddleware());

// Define a protected route
app.get('/protected', requireAuth, (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route');
});

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
