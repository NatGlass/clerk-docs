## Access user data in the backend

By using Clerk's [`GetUserList`](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/GetUserList){{ target: '_blank' }} Backend API endpoint, you can programmatically export your user's data safely.

Additionally, the [`getUserList()`](/docs/references/backend/user/get-user-list) method in the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) can also be used to retrieve a list of users.

## Export your users' data from the Clerk Dashboard

In addition to programmatically exporting user data via Clerk's API or SDK, weâ€™ve introduced a feature in the Clerk Dashboard that allows customers to export user data directly.

Customers, who are either admins or in their personal workspace, can now export and download a CSV file containing a list of their users that _includes their hashed passwords_ from the Dashboard Exports page. 

Additionally, on the same page, customers can view detailed export and download history logs. These logs offer a record of previous export actions, ensuring visibility and traceability of data exports within the dashboard.
