Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Fastify backend for secure user authentication and management. This guide uses TypeScript and allows you to choose your frontend framework.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Fastify is only compatible with Next.js versions 13.4 and below](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-nextjs). If you're using a newer version of Next.js, consider using a different backend framework that supports the latest Next.js features.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using ECMAScript Modules (ESM) in your project, you must include `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` to enable ESM support in Node.js.

<Steps>
  ### Create a Clerk application

  You need to create a Clerk application in your Clerk Dashboard before you can set up Clerk Fastify. For more information, refer to the [Set up your application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) guide.

  ### Install `@clerk/fastify`

  Once your application is ready, install [Clerk's Fastify SDK](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/tree/main/packages/fastify). The SDK gives you access to our prebuilt components and hooks for your application.

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/fastify

    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/fastify
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/fastify
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env.local` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
    1. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
    1. Paste your keys into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ### Configure `clerkPlugin` for all routes

  The `clerkPlugin` can be registered globally or for specific routes. The following example registers the plugin for all routes. To register the plugin for specific routes only, refer to the [**Using Clerk for specific pages only**](/docs/quickstarts/fastify#using-clerk-for-specific-routes-only) section.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The `dotenv/config` module must be imported before any Clerk modules. This order is important because Clerk instances are created during the import process and rely on environment variables, such as API keys, to be initialized correctly. For more details, refer to the [Fastify docs](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Guides/Getting-Started/#loading-order-of-your-plugins).

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts' }}
  import 'dotenv/config'
  import Fastify from 'fastify'
  import { clerkPlugin } from '@clerk/fastify'

  const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true })

  fastify.register(clerkPlugin)

  const start = async () => {
    try {
      await fastify.listen({ port: 8080 })
      fastify.log.info('Server is running on port 8080.')
    } catch (err) {
      fastify.log.error(err)
      process.exit(1)
    }
  }

  start()
  ```

  ### Use `getAuth()` to access the current auth state

  The `getAuth()` method can access the authentation state of the current request. In the following example, the `userId` loads the entire [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user) object from Clerk.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts', mark: [3, [9, 15]] }}
  import 'dotenv/config'
  import Fastify from 'fastify'
  import { clerkClient, clerkPlugin, getAuth } from '@clerk/fastify'

  const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true })

  fastify.register(clerkPlugin)

  // Declare a route and access the auth state for this request
  fastify.get('/', async (req, reply) => {
    const { userId } = getAuth(req)
    const user = userId ? await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId) : null
    reply.send({ message: 'Authentication state retrieved successfully.' })
    return { user }
  })

  const start = async () => {
    try {
      await fastify.listen({ port: 8080 })
      fastify.log.info('Server is running on port 8080.')
    } catch (err) {
      fastify.log.error(err)
      process.exit(1)
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Protect specific routes

  To protect a route using Clerk, use the `getAuth()` method to check if the user is authenticated.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts' }}
  fastify.get('/protected', async (request, reply) => {
    const { userId } = getAuth(request)
    if (!userId) {
      return reply.code(403).send({ message: 'Access denied. Authentication required.' })
    }

    const user = await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId)
    return { user }
  })
  ```
</Steps>

### Configure `clerkPlugin` for specific routes only

If you want to use Clerk for specific pages only, you can register the plugin for specific routes. In the following example, the routes are split into public and private routes.

```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts' }}
import 'dotenv/config'
import Fastify, { FastifyPluginCallback } from 'fastify'
import { clerkClient, clerkPlugin, getAuth } from '@clerk/fastify'

const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true })

const protectedRoutes: FastifyPluginCallback = (instance, options, done) => {
  instance.register(clerkPlugin)

  instance.get('/protected', async (request, reply) => {
    const { userId } = getAuth(request)
    if (!userId) {
      return reply.code(403).send({ message: 'Access denied. Authentication required.' })
    }

    const user = await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId)

    // Only authenticated users will see the following message
    reply.send({ message: 'This is a protected route.' })
    return { user }
  })

  done()
}

const publicRoutes: FastifyPluginCallback = (instance, options, done) => {
  instance.get('/', async (request, reply) => {
    return { message: 'This is a public route.' }
  })

  done()
}

fastify.register(protectedRoutes)
fastify.register(publicRoutes)

const start = async () => {
  try {
    await fastify.listen({ port: 8080 })
  } catch (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err)
    process.exit(1)
  }
}

start()
```
